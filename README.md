# DCGAN
Repository creating [a deep convolutional generative adversarial network](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1511.06434.pdf) by Radford et al.2015 in tensorflow

### What does it do?
DCGANs generate images using CNNs

### How does it work?
There are two parts to most [Generative Adversarial Networks](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1406.2661.pdf) by Goodfellow et al. 2014
- a generator which generates images (using transposed CNN, aka deconvolution)
- a discriminator which decides if the images are real or fake (using normal CNN)   

Steps of a GAN:
1. Batches of images from a real-image dataset and images from the generator are inputed into the discriminator
	- discriminator learns real features from generated features by backpropogating to the inputed images
	- backpropogate through the discriminator only
	- use 0 as labels for generated images
	- use 1 as lables for real images
	- I call the sum of these losses the discriminator loss as the goal is to change the values of the discriminator during backpropogation
2. Backpropogate through whole discriminator-generator model with 1 as a label
	- This will allow the generator to learn the features of real images which the discriminator learned
	- I call the loss (from the discriminator) in this process the 'generator loss' as the goal is to change the values of the generator during backpropogation

Model trained on [CIFAR10](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html), [MNIST](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/), and [LSUN](https://github.com/fyu/lsun) bedroom datasets  

Discriminator is an [allCNN](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1412.6806.pdf) Tobias et al. 2014 with fully connected layer instead of global average pooling

### Goal:
Practical Goal:
- to train the discriminator loss to be the same as the generator loss.
	- this means that the real and generated images are so similar, that the discriminator doesn't know which is real or fake   
	
Technical Goal:
- to let the model learn features and be able to map random noise to a created manifold in the image space which has significant features of one category.
- the goal is to learn these manifolds

### Files:
Files in this repository:
- cifar10_input.py:
	- provides batches of unaltered cifar10 images to model
- model.py:
	- DCGAN model
- util.py:
	- functions to simplify model.py (these are not in model.py to keep it short)
- train.py:
	- trains data while saving sample images on a predefined epoch
	
### Problems throughout the experiment:
- Generator doesn't converge while discriminator converges completely to an accuracy of 99%
	- can be solved by crippling the discriminator, Possible fixes:
		- adding noise to labels -> this solves problem
		- training generator more often
		- add hidden layer noise to discriminator with dropout
		- minimize loss difference between discriminator and generator to train generator
		- reduce number of discriminator layers
		- reduce width of generator layer
- generator only produces static
	- solved by replacing global average pooling with fully connected layer on the output from discriminator
	- Fixed: replaced tf.nn.avg_pool function with tf.reduce_mean function
- images generated by CIFAR is at best, very blurry, and will deteriorate at a certain point.
